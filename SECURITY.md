## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of OpenInspection seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us by following these steps:

1. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.** This allows us to fix the issue before it's exploited.
2. Report the vulnerability directly via **[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/InspectorHub/OpenInspection/security/advisories/new)**. This is the most secure way to transmit details privately to our team.
3. Include as much detail as possible:
    * Type of issue (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, RCE)
    * Steps to reproduce
    * Potential impact
    * (Optional) Proposed fix or mitigation

### Response Time

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a preliminary assessment of the issue. We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a fix is implemented and verified, we will:

1. Release a new version.
2. Publish a security advisory if appropriate.
3. Credit the researcher (if desired).

## Security Best Practices for Deployers

* **JWT_SECRET**: Ensure your `JWT_SECRET` is at least 32 characters long and cryptographically secure. The `setup:cloudflare` script handles tokens automatically.
* **WAF**: Enable Cloudflare WAF (Web Application Firewall) on your Worker's route for additional protection against common attacks.
* **Access Logs**: Review your Cloudflare Logs regularly to detect suspicious activity.
